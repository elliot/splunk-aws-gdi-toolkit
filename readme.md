# Splunk AWS GDI Tookit

This repo is for individuals and organizations looking to get better visibility, observability, and monitoring in their AWS account or AWS accounts.  There are sets of CloudFormation templates here designed to help get data related to AWS accounts and services to Splunk for analysis and alerting.

PRs are open, and feel free to reach out to me over the [Splunk Usergroups Slack](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Community/current/community/Chat) if you have questions, comments, or concerns!

Documentation for how to deploy the toolkit, design decisions, diagrams, and FAQs can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-aws-gdi-toolkit/wiki).
